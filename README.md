# Impulse-Planet-Pack
Impulse Planet Pack is a planet pack in which you surf your "solar" system with challenges o' plenty!


Impulse planet pack takes place in an alternate timeline in which the kerbals evolve on a moon of a pretty big gas giant (Florb) known as Fog. Fog's habitability is... Questionable at best. The cloud layer covers almost all light recieve from Velocity. Velocity, being a black hole, doesnt output much light to begin with. The only light you would recieve is from the accretion disc, but otherwise, you're on your own. The main goal of this planet pack is to leave the Velocity system for a far safer system. You have 2 other "Positive" systems and 3 "negative" systems. A side-goal would be to master getting to and landing on all landable planets, including the harder-than-tylo like planet known as Boulder-A.
